      <p class="w3-large">My name is SAI RUTHVIK REDDY SOLIPURAM, and I have a keen interest in the field of computer science. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for technology and its applications. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at MVSR Engineering College.

During my studies, I have actively explored various areas within computer science, including software development, data analysis, and cloud computing. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the industry.

In terms of internships, I have had the opportunity to work with Splash BI and Accenture, which has provided me with valuable hands-on experience. At Splash BI, I gained insights into business intelligence and analytics, where I had the chance to work on data visualization projects and extract meaningful insights from large datasets. During my internship at Accenture, I was exposed to the world of consulting and had the chance to contribute to software development projects, collaborating with teams to deliver efficient solutions.

Looking ahead, I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in cloud computing and have set my sights on specializing in Amazon Web Services (AWS). I am fascinated by the versatility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness that cloud computing offers, and I believe that AWS provides a comprehensive platform to explore and deploy innovative solutions. My goal is to gain expertise in AWS services and architecting cloud solutions to address real-world challenges.

Overall, my academic background, internship experiences at Splash BI and Accenture, and my future interest in AWS demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and my desire to contribute to the exciting field of computer science. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the industry and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.
